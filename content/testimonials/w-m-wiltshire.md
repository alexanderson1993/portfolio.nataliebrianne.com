I was looking for an illustrator for my new novel, “On the Brink of Extinction,” and Natalie was recommended to me by my previous cover designer, Melissa Williams Design. I reached out to Natalie and after a few emails, she was able to design exactly what I was looking for: cute animals, not cartoonish, but more Disney-like. And I received the illustration within a very tight timeframe. It was a pleasure working with you, Natalie. I would recommend you to anyone looking for a very talented professional.
