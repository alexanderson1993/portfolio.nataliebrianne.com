Natalie Brianne created a wonderful series of illustrations for Five Bugs in Meadow. She truly captured the essence of the characters envisioned by the story and was a pleasure to work with. The creativity process involves a lot of back and forth communication of ideas which Brianne made very simple and easy. I highly recommend Natalie Brianne for your childrenâ€™s book or illustration project.
