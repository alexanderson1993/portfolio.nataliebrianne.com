Hi there! My name is Natalie Brianne, and I have been a student of the arts for practically my entire life. I found a fascination with Picasso when I was four, became obsessed with the Renaissance when I was eleven, and fell in love with Impressionism when I was fourteen. It’s no wonder that I went into the Humanities, where I studied art styles as varied as the humans who created them. All along the way, I’ve been drawing, painting, illustrating, and designing. 



The bottom line is, stories are my life blood and I love bringing them to life through color, texture, and shape. If you trust me with your precious characters, I will do everything I can to do them justice. 



What styles/mediums do you use?



While there are certain styles that I am more familiar with, I am open and willing to try to replicate the style that you are looking at for your work. I like to keep an open dialog with my clients during the illustration process to make sure that every detail is right.



Most of the work that I do is digital. I use my iPad Pro and Procreate to bring your work to life, meaning that I can make color changes, add details, move characters, and change entire backgrounds if necessary. I also am proficient in Adobe Indesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator, so if we need additional tweaks that Procreate can’t handle, we have it covered. 



I can also create your illustration traditionally if you prefer. The one downside with traditional mediums is that once something is in place, it is significantly harder to move and adjust. The mediums I am familiar with include:



* Watercolor
* Colored Pencil
* Alcohol Markers
* Acrylic
* Graphite/Charcoal
* Ink



What are your prices?



When I give you a quote, I take into account the following:



* The amount of time I believe it will take me to complete it.
* The number of character designs required/the number of figures in each illustration.
* The complexity of the background elements, if a background is required.
* Cost of materials if you choose to have the illustrations done traditionally instead of digitally.



 Examples:



* For a single character design, no background, the cost would be between $50 and $100 depending on the complexity of the character.
* For a full illustration the cost can range from $300-$1000+ depending on the number of characters, complexity of the background, and materials if you go with traditional methods. 
* If you hire me for more than one illustration/project, I will bundle the price so that it is more affordable. 



How long will it take you to finish my illustration?

When I give you a quote, that includes the timeframe for the project. Once again, this includes the number of characters, illustrations, and background complexity, as well as the number of changes you request/how quickly you approve designs. I also take into account the number of projects I am working on and my personal life. Despite this, I do generally have a quick turn around. For a highly detailed piece, expect 6+ weeks. If it is a simple project that requires few changes, it might be 2 weeks or less. It really depends on your individual project. 



What does the illustration process look like?



Once the quote is agreed upon, I’ll start making preliminary sketches and thumbnails for the illustrations/character design. If you have any references, aesthetic boards, or sketches of your own that you want me to go off of, this is the time to share them! We’ll go back and forth on the thumbnails, making sure that you like the trajectory of the design. This is also the point where we’ll talk about color theory and layout to try and find the most dynamic and visually pleasing composition.



Once we’ve agreed on the thumbnail, I’ll get to work on the main sketch. From here there are a few stages when I will ask you for your input and make sure it is going in the direction you want:

* Character design
* Initial character sketch
* Background
* Color composition
* Details
* Lighting and finishing touches



Once you’ve approved the final version, I’ll send you an invoice through PayPal or Venmo, and send you the high quality files of your illustration.
